LLVM  is  the  compiler  that  is  sophisticated program.  However,  the  Dooms day  might  be  coming.  LLVM much  growing  well.  But, is  it  safe?  Is it  reliable?  That  is  another  space.
Over-Belief  is might  be  dangerous. And, its  architecture,  really  trustworthy? Whenever,  the  dragon can  be  scrape  the  sky,  however, the  reverse things might  be  could  happens.  This  is  not just  some  parts  problem.  Such total bodies  must be better  and  advanced  to be.
The crab, riding on  the  dragon,  is  not  stable. when while the  riding the dragon, crab itself  couldn't control  the dragon. dragon  itself  cannot  manipulate  the those embodiments.  That dragon might  be  fail,  because  of  its own  power. These all  things will  be  occured  in  2~3 years. Physical  AI is  now begun. Then, why  the  target is  llvm?  Cause  of  the  llvm  is  the  basis of  modern software  infrastructue, is widespread.  
Then,  Rust can  be  problem-solver? The answer is : "not  yet" . Because of  the  rust depend  on  the LLVM's  tool so deeply, the  independace does not successfully. 

 The way : the collaborating  of  the  students  and  the  companies (enterprises also). Logic  parts are  constructed  by  students  and  enterprises, and  assembly and  hardware embodiments  are  by  companies.  Thats  the  unique  answer.Or, rewrite the  clean  version llvm with Ada. The  reader  might  be say:  why? : The  answer: "It  is  fully  fit to  rewrite  the  LLVM", because of the ada is the historically  strict and  safe  language ever.  And  write  the  RUST with this new  LLVM.


p.s : Orchard tree nurture  the dragon.  Farmers  of  the orchard love the  bird  and  the  object: The  bird. However, the  bird  is  mimic the  dragons flying. How sad things..
